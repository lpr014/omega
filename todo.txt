these are MUST DO's for the project. BE SURE THESE ARE DONE!

-Must have no less than 25 user stories

-Play "planning poker" with the user stories 
(amounts to use are: 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, infinity, '?')

-When we get Jira, transfer user stories and data (points) to Jira

-Create acceptance criteria for each user story and write these in Jira

-Create a new sprint and select which ones to include in the sprint

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-MUST use test-driven development and must use an automated test framework to create and run your
tests. Use the acceptance criteria to design your tests

-Create a public GitHub project and link all of your local Git repos containing 
the project code and the unit tests to this GitHub repo so you can push your 
commits to it.
