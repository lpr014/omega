Introduction
------------

* The Calculator is a command line calculator module that computed various, 2 variable equations. It is currently able to compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, interger division, mod., factorial, powers, square root, and n-th roots. Pi and e are currently also available as well has a 'history' function and 'clear' history function.

 

Requirements
------------

* There are no special Requirements for this project, other than having python 2.7.



Installation
------------

* There is no installation process! Just cd to the directory where the program files are stored in command line, and execute 'python Calc_Main.py' in the command line.


Configuration
-------------

* This module has no menu or modifiable settings.

Use
---

* history: type 'history' to view history from [FOREVER]. Able to use last recorded answer in next equation (i.e. +5,-5,*5,/5)

* clear: type 'clear' to clear entire history

* Addition { 5+5 }

* Subtraction { 5-5 }

* Multiplication { 5*5 }

* Division { 5/5 }

* Integer Division { 5//5 }

* Mod. { 5%5 }

* Factorial { 5! }

* Power { 5^5 }

* Square root { sqrt(5) }

* n-th root { 5rt(25) }

* pi { pi() }

* e { e() }
